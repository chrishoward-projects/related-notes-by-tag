Here’s a plan to address the sidebar state reset bug and implement the requested features:

---

## 1. Bug Analysis & Root Cause

- **Current Bug:** Clicking outside the related notes sidebar resets the expand/collapse state of tag groups.
- **Likely Cause:** The sidebar component is being re-rendered or re-initialized on blur or focus loss, causing state to reset.

---

## 2. Desired Behavior

- Sidebar should retain the expand/collapse state of tag groups when focus is lost or user clicks outside.
- When switching notes, do not apply the previous note’s group state to the new note.
- Maintain a history (array) of the 5 most recent notes’ group expand/collapse states.
- Make the history size (default 5) a user-configurable setting.

---

## 3. Implementation Plan

### A. Sidebar State Management

- Refactor sidebar state to be stored in a persistent, plugin-level object (not just in the UI component).
- Key the state by note identifier (e.g., file path or unique note ID).
- On sidebar render, check if there’s a saved state for the current note and apply it.

### B. Prevent State Reset on Blur

- Ensure that UI state is not reset on blur/focus loss.
- Only update the state when the user interacts with tag groups (expand/collapse), or when switching notes.

### C. Recent Notes State History

- Maintain an array of up to N (default 5) recent notes’ group states.
- When a note is viewed, move its state to the front of the array.
- If the array exceeds N, remove the oldest entry.
- When switching notes, only apply the state for the current note (do not apply previous note’s state to a new note).

### D. Settings Option

- Add a plugin setting for “Number of recent notes to remember group state for” (default: 5, min: 1, max: 20).
- Update the state management logic to respect this setting.

### E. Persistence

- Store the recent notes’ group states in plugin settings or local storage, so they persist across Obsidian restarts.

### F. Testing

- Test the following scenarios:
  - Collapsing/expanding groups, clicking outside, and returning: state is preserved.
  - Switching between notes: each note remembers its own group state.
  - Exceeding the history limit: oldest note’s state is dropped.
  - Changing the history size in settings: array resizes accordingly.

## 4. Steps to Implement

1. Refactor sidebar state management to be keyed by note and persist in plugin-level storage.
2. Update UI logic to prevent state reset on blur/focus loss.
3. Implement the recent notes state array with configurable size.
4. Add a settings option for the history size.
5. Ensure persistence across sessions.
6. Test all edge cases.
