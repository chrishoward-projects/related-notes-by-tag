I've analyzed the codebase and identified the root cause of the issue. Here's what's happening:

## The Problem
When you click outside the sidebar, it triggers an `active-leaf-change` event, which calls `updateView()`. This method completely rebuilds the entire sidebar UI by:
1. Calling `this.container.empty()` - destroying all DOM elements
2. Re-rendering everything from scratch using the default group state from settings
3. This loses any user interactions like collapsed/expanded tag groups

## My Solution Plan

I propose a **Hybrid Approach** that combines smart update detection with UI state preservation:

### 1. **Add State Tracking System**
- Track the expansion state of each tag group by tag name
- Store this in the `RelatedNotesView` class as a private property
- Persist state across updates

### 2. **Add Content Change Detection**
- Before rebuilding the UI, compare the new content with current content
- Only trigger full rebuild when:
  - Active file changes
  - Tag content actually changes (different tags or different related files)
  - Settings change
- Skip rebuild for simple focus changes that don't affect content

### 3. **State Preservation & Restoration**
- Before calling `container.empty()`, save current expansion states
- After rebuilding, restore the saved states to the new tag groups
- Handle edge cases (tags that no longer exist, new tags)

### 4. **Optimize Event Handling**
- Modify the `active-leaf-change` listener to be more intelligent
- Add a helper method to determine if content update is actually needed

## Implementation Details

**New Properties in RelatedNotesView:**
```typescript
private tagGroupStates: Map<string, boolean> = new Map(); // tag -> expanded state
private lastActiveFile: TFile | null = null;
private lastRelatedNotesContent: string = ''; // hash of current content
```

**New Methods:**
- `saveTagGroupStates()` - capture current UI state
- `restoreTagGroupStates()` - apply saved state to new elements  
- `contentNeedsUpdate()` - detect if rebuild is actually needed
- `updateViewSmartly()` - replacement for current `updateView()`

This approach maintains the dynamic nature while preserving user interactions. The plugin will still update when content changes, but won't reset the UI state on every focus change.
